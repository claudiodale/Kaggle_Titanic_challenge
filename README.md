# Kaggle_Titanic_challenge

My classification model to predict whether passengers of the titanic survived or not.

I ended up obtaining an accuracy of 79,9% which allowed me to position 2880 out of 55+k partecipants.

In creating a model I created several new features like categorical feature for the fare, categorical feature for the age, new categorical feature related to the "Title" of the passenger (Mr, Miss, etc..), new features highlithing if a passenger was travelling alone or with more than 3 people.
I obtained the best results using a RandomForest Classifier.
